# Hi there 👋

📡 ➝ I’m currently working on [ValaGames](https://valagames.fr/).  

   ValaGames is a French network of Minecraft, Minis-Games and innovations!
   It is currently under development, if you want to know more, feel free to join the Discord server to be kept informed of the latest news!


➝ In my spare time, I often develop in Java, but I also rarely do JavaScript and some other web languages.


In the coming weeks/months repositories should be published in public!
